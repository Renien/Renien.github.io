### Developer

> In the beginning, there were Real Programmers. - Eric S. Raymond


* [**Source Tree**](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/){:target="_blank"} <b>#Mac #Git</b>
<br>Truly an amazing app for GIT GUI for Mac users. It's a great GIT client in its own right.

* [**GitThub**](https://windows.github.com/){:target="_blank"} <b>#Windows #Git</b>
<br>Best GIT GUI application for widows.

* [**CodeMaid**](http://www.codemaid.net/){:target="_blank"} <b>#VisualStudio</b>
<br>I like cleaning up the code as daily basis. It works great not only for c# code but also most of the .net languages. It helped me allot to maintain and clean very lager scaled projects. I agree, you don’t need to use the tool very often but when you use it does the job very well. It’s awesome utility to reformat a huge bunch of files.

* [**Resharper**](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/){:target="_blank"} <b>#VisualStudio #jetbrains</b>
<br>Do you write elegant code? I have doubt in it ;). R# is a tool that I use and absolutely love it. Give it a try.

* [**Postman**](http://www.getpostman.com/){:target="_blank"}
<br>To test your Web Service call, use an amazing HTTP and REST client tool that runs inside Google Chrome.

* [**Atom**](https://atom.io/){:target="_blank"}
<br> Atom is a new editor from GitHub.  Can easily Integrate with Git and GitHub. Awesome editor!

* [**Brackets**](http://brackets.io/){:target="_blank"}
<br> Bracket is an open source editor from Adobe. Web developers will love this editor. Lots of plugins available to add more features to brackets. Works really well with Git and GitHub.

> Personally, I love Brackets more than Atom ;)

* [**Chocolatey**](https://chocolatey.org/){:target="_blank"}
<br> Chocolatey NuGet is a Machine Package Manager, somewhat like apt-get, but built with Windows in mind. This makes developers life easy to install and start the development on windows.
