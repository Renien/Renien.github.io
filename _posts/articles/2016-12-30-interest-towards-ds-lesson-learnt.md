It’s been a long time I shared some valuable information. Because half-year in 2016, I was spending long time aggressively building myself to fill my gaps to work on some very interesting projects.

Being in IT field there are numerous areas and opportunities to work. Honestly, I think I have almost experienced in each area with small ground level knowledge. But nothing interested me like working with data. Actually, the interest was started in mid 2015 and I wrote a first article on [**“Learn about Big Data”**](http://renien.com/articles/learn-about-big-data/){:target="_blank"}. After reading so many blogs and articles at the end in a nutshell Figure 1 shows the skill sets that you need to work on Data Science field. I fear a lot looking at Big Data and Data Science.

I always believe technology, should give us superpowers and the data is the soul of everything, so thought of let’s give it a try.

It is still not an easy journey every day we learn new things from everywhere. But when I look back from mid 2015 up to now it surprises me that I didn’t know much stuff back in that time. Many people will have their own different goals. But I like to put it in different way,

> Fix your goals as what you really like to do and “makes you happy”

In year 2016, spoke to lot of professionals and students about goals and being happy in what they are doing.  Most of them are still confused about it. I believe it is good sign because I always have it in my self too. 

The confusion helps to open up the untouched energy in your brain and before taking a decision you would consider lots of factors. But then decisions can go wrong it is up to you to overcome and work towards the next steps.

The current situation is different. The growth of technology has brought everything to our door steps. If you think to learn new stuffs in your field, there are plenty and more resources available out there in internet and it is in our hand to find all our diamonds.

Later when you realise what you actually want to do in your life, My dear friends just don’t think your too late. Take the day as your start date and work hard on them and results will follow you.
