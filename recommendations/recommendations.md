“
I have worked with Renien for 4 years and he is an extremely bright and hard working person. He is very responsible and an extremely good data science engineer. He has worked under a lot of hard deadlines and has delivered every single time and also manages to maintain his composure and deliver high quality work. He is also a natural leader who mentors a team of data science engineers.

I've known and worked with Renien for more than 5 years at Zone24x7, and has directly managed Renien for around 2 years. From the beginning, Renien was earmarked at Zone24x7 to be one of those very few to be mentored and groomed under the accelerated career growth plan, purely because of his natural leadership skills in both IQ and EQ aspects. He did not disappoint this decision of Zone24x7 management, and became one of the best team/tech leads at Zone24x7 in a very short number of years. Having an in depth and breadth of knowledge in Big Data and Data Science disciplines, Renien was one of the key Data Science Engineering Tech Leads in my team who help beat RichRelevance at a Tier-1 retailer in USA with an in-house developed Product Recommendations and Personalization solution just under 3 years. Significantly respected by clients, peers, juniors and seniors alike, any company having the privilege to work with Renien, should without any hesitation. I would personally not have even the sligtest hesitation to hire Renien for any of my future endeavours.

It was a pleasure to work together with Renien, who is a hard working and dedicated engineer. Renien did an exceptional job on the recent projects related to Bigdata analytics. Smart, customer focused and proactive. Is always capable of adapting to new technology. He is also strong on research and publications. Always wish to have him in my team!
